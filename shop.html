        At Sunnyhill Farm, our cattle and sheep are bred and reared naturally in
        the beautiful Clyde Valley. Choose from a wide range of beef, veal,
        lamb, and chicken. We also supply a variety of cold meats. We grow a
        wide variety of seasonal fruit and vegetables. When these are out of
        season, they are available frozen, so you can enjoy them all year round.
        We also supply produce from other parts of the country and the rest of
        the world.
        <br />
        We have a small café attached to the farm shop so people can enjoy their
        purchases immediately. Some of the most popular items in a farm shop
